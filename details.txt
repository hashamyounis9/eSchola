1. Signup/ login validations to [backend]
2. Styling [Suggested combination if you can override.. #386776 bg --fg-->white]
3. Demo for an enrolled and hosted class have been hardcoded to show how it might look like.
4. Was having problem with creating class and inserting that into the table first row was 
problematic for both of the tables. please look into that.
5. In enrolled classes and hosted classes both would require dynamic url redirection[you'd know better]
and having the visual of how it would be like.
6. In hosted classes, the creating assignments and quizes is done, the viewing enrolled students and receiving the request for
enrollment were missed out. 
7. Progress Panel got 0 progress.

GOOOD LUCK!
